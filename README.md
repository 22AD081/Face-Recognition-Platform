##  Components

### 1. `face_backend/`
- Built using Flask.
- Responsible for face registration and recognition.
- Uses the `face_recognition` library to match user faces in real-time.

### 2. `face-rag-client/`
- React-based frontend interface.
- Enables user interaction with both face recognition and Q&A components.

### 3. `rag_engine/`
- Implements a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system.
- Uses:
  - **LangChain** for pipeline construction.
  - **FAISS** for vector search.
  - **OpenAI GPT** for answering user questions based on retrieved context.
